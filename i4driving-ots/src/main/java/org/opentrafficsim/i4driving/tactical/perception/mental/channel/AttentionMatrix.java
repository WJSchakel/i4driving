/**
 * This class describes attention over channels, based on task demand per channel. Transition probabilities are based on demand
 * per channel, where drivers are assumed to keep perceiving the same channel by the demand of that channel alone. When total
 * demand is above 1, this means that the probability of switching to another channel is reduced. All transition probabilities
 * together result in an overall steady-state, which describes what fraction of time is spent on what channel.
