# i4driving
This project contains an extension of OTS (https://github.com/averbraeck/opentrafficsim) for the i4Driving research project. In this project OTS is extended to be a suitable testing environment for self-driving vehicles. This is achieved by letting automated vehicles drive in simulation, interacting with vehicles that are modelled with state-of-the-art models for human drivers. These models include social interactions and human factors on perception and imperfect driving.
